            <h2>Subic Bay,Philippines</h2>
                <p>I was born on a naval base in Subic Bay, Philippines. I came to the United States at the age of two and have not been back since. Being so young when moving to the States I dont remember anything about living there but I have always wanted to go back.</p>

            <h3>San Diego, California</h3>
                <p>I lived in San Diego from age two to fourteen. I loved it there. The weather was always beautiful and nearly every weekend we would go to the beach. We moved when my dad retired, and I was not happy at all when we had to leave.</p>

            <h4>Mascoutah, Illinois</h4>
                <p>I moved to Mascoutah, Illinois my freshman year of highschool. Initially I hated it and it took a long time for that to change. Moving from San Diego to Mascoutah was a huge change especially since I had never seen snow before. I've grown to appreciate Mascoutah, but I still dont like the snow.</p>
                
            <h5>Fremont, Ohio</h5>
                <p>Shortly after my dad passed I moved to Fremont, Ohio. Fremont is about a half hour away from Lake Erie as well as Sandusky which is where Cedar Point and Kalahari are. During the summer time there was a lot to do and it was great. Winter time on the other hand was complete opposite. I lived there for a few years then decided I wanted to move back to the Saint Louis area.</p>  
                
            <h6>Ofallon, Illinois</h6> 
                <p>When I left Ohio I moved to Ofallon, Illinois. My main reason for moving there was because of the schools. At that time my son was in second grade so living somewhere that had a good system was a priority. My son loved the school that he was attending so I stayed there until he finished elementary school then moved back to Mascoutah.</p>
