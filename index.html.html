            <h2>Subic Bay, Philippines</h2>
                <p>I was born on a naval base in Subic Bay, Philippines. I came to the United States at the age of two and have not been back since. Being so young when moving to the United States I unfortunately dont remember anything about living there and I have always wanted to go back. My mom travels to the Philippines every few years to visit with family.She actually just went to visit last year for Thanksgving. Although I dont remember any of the family members I met there when I was a baby, there are a few that I am friends with on Facebook. A lot of the time they post in Tagalog which I dont know how to speak but I do love seeing all of the pictures of the beautiul scenery.</p>

            <h2>San Diego, California</h3>
                <p> When we left the Philippines we moved to California. I lived in San Diego from age two to fourteen. I loved it there. The weather was always pleasant and nearly every weekend we would go to the beach to swim or to the pier to fish. We were also less that two hours from several amusement parks so would go there often as well. We moved from San Diego when my dad retired, and I was not happy at all to leave.</p>

            <h2>Mascoutah, Illinois</h4>
                <p> A lot of my dads side of the family still lives in Belleville, Illinois. So when my dad retired from the navy he wanted to come home and be close to his family. That is why we moved to Mascoutah. We came to Mascoutah my freshman year of highschool. Initially, I hated it and it took a very long time for that to change. Moving from San Diego to Mascoutah was a huge change especially since I had never seen snow before.  It has taken me years but I've grown to appreciate Mascoutah. Being older and a family of my own now I understand why my father chose to live in a small town with good schools.</p>

            <h2>Fremont, Ohio</h5>
                <p>Shortly after my dad passed away I moved to Fremont, Ohio. Fremont is about a half hour away from Lake Erie as well as Sandusky which is where Cedar Point and Kalahari are. During the summer time there is a lot to do and it was great. Winter time on the other hand was complete opposite. Being a bartender at the time jobs were endless during the summer. Yet, the only steady year round work there was in factories. In Fremont itself there is the Heinz factory. Near by towns had the Whirlpool, Delphi, and Chrysler factories. I lived in Fremont for a few years then decided I wanted to move back to the Saint Louis area. Both my siblings and their families still live in the Fremont area.</p>

            <h2>Ofallon, Illinois</h6> 
                <p>When I left Ohio I moved to Ofallon, Illinois. My main reason for moving there was because Ofallon has a good school system. At that time my son was in second grade so living somewhere that had a good schooling was a priority. I lived in walking distance from both the park and the library so I took my son to both all the time. My son attended LaVerna Evans Elementary school and absolutely loved it there so I stayed until he finished elementary school then moved back to Mascoutah.</p>
